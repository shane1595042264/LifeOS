# North Star: A Unified Productivity Operating System

## Vision
Just as physicists seek a unified theory for the universe, we, as productive power users, seek a unified application for our digital lives. We are building a system with four distinct layers to create a single, cohesive operating system where all productivity apps connect, share data, and generate insights. This document is the North Star for that vision.

## 🏔️ Layer 1: Identity Layer — “Who I Am”

**Purpose:** Your foundation. This layer defines your core values, health baselines, personality patterns, and long-term direction. It is the most stable layer and changes infrequently.

**Contains:**
- **Life Mission & Core Principles:** The fundamental constitution of your life.
- **Health & Energy Baseline:** Your physical and mental performance metrics.
- **Psychological Observations:** Insights into your personality, strengths, and weaknesses (e.g., Myers-Briggs, Big Five).
- **Long-term Visions & Motivations:** Your "why." What drives you forward.
- **Version History:** A log of your personal evolution (e.g., LifeOS v1.0 → v1.1).

**This layer answers:**
> What kind of person am I building myself into?

## ⚖️ Layer 2: System Layer — “Life Engine / Rules”

**Purpose:** Your life's laws and operating protocols. This is not a diary. It is the documentation for the machine—you. It defines the logic for how you operate.

**Sub-sections:**
- **Time Management System:** Protocols for allocating your time.
- **Finance / W Token Economy:** Rules for managing your resources.
- **Entertainment Protocols:** Guidelines for leisure and rest.
- **Growth & Learning System:** Processes for acquiring knowledge and skills.

**This layer answers:**
> How should I operate in any given situation? What are the rules I must follow?

## ⚙️ Layer 3: Execution Layer — “Daily Life Usage”

**Purpose:** Where real life happens. This is the layer of daily and weekly action, designed for rapid, templated interaction.

**Includes:**
- **Logs:** Daily journals, habit tracking, and activity records.
- **Contracts:** Agreements and commitments with yourself and others.
- **Tables:** Structured data for tracking specific activities (e.g., workouts, reading lists).
- **Projects:** Active initiatives with defined goals and tasks.

**This layer answers:**
> What am I doing right now?

## 📈 Layer 4: Insights & Evolution — “Self-Research”

**Purpose:** Turning your life into data and turning that data into upgraded versions of yourself. This is where self-reflection meets analytics.

**Includes:**
- **Metrics Dashboard:** Visualizations for key life data (sleep, resource usage, time allocation, mood trends).
- **Habit Patterns & Triggers:** Analysis of what drives your behaviors.
- **Experiments & Behavior Studies:** A/B testing different habits and routines.
- **LifeOS Version Updates:** The output of your research—concrete plans for evolving your Identity and System layers.

**This layer answers:**
> Why do I behave the way I do? How do I evolve into a better version of myself?
